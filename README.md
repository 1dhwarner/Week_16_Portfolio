# David's Week_16_Portfolio

Portfolio to demonstrate the progress I made in the first 8 weeks of attending the University of Denver Coding boot camp.

This is technically the second iteration of my portfolio after an earlier homework assignment.

The application is deployed here: https://1dhwarner.github.io/Week_08_Portfolio/
